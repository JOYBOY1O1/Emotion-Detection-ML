# Emotion-Detection-ML

pip install -r required_lib.txt

This project involves building a convolutional neural network (CNN) using Keras to classify emotions from facial expressions. The CNN model is trained on grayscale images of faces labeled with seven emotions (angry, disgust, fear, happy, neutral, sad, surprise) upto 100 epochs. After training, the model is capable of predicting the emotion depicted in a given face image from the test set, demonstrating its ability to recognize emotional states from facial features.
